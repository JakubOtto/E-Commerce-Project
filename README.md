# E-Commerce Project - Programming Workshop IV
Welcome to the E-Commerce project developed as part of the Programming Workshop IV course conducted at Cracow University of Economics! 

# Project Overview
In this workshop, we are building an E-Commerce application from scratch. The project covers a wide range of functionalities typical of an E-Commerce platform, including product browsing, cart management, order processing, and more.

# Objectives
- ### Learn Test-Driven Development (TDD): Practice writing tests before implementing features to ensure robust and reliable code.

- ### Apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Design and develop maintainable, scalable code using OOP principles.

- ### Implement best practices and design patterns: Follow industry best practices and utilize design patterns to solve real-world problems encountered in E-Commerce applications.

## Features

### SalesFacade Integration

The project utilizes `SalesFacade`, which orchestrates various components including cart management and payment processing.

### OfferCalculator with Promotions and Discounts

`OfferCalculator` is integrated to calculate offers with promotions and discounts applied, ensuring accurate pricing for customers.

### Shopping Cart System

A robust shopping cart system is implemented to allow users to add and manage products before checkout.

### Integration with PayU for Payments

Integration with PayU provides secure and convenient payment processing. The project is configured to use PayU's sandbox environment for testing payment functionalities before going live.

# Technologies Used

- ### Java: A widely used programming language known for its robustness and versatility.

- ### Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java-based applications, providing features like dependency injection and MVC architecture.

- ### JUnit: A popular unit testing framework for Java, essential for practicing Test-Driven Development.

# Testing
- ### Unit Tests
- ### Integration Tests
- ### End-to-End (E2E) Tests

# The project is currently under active development and will continue to be expanded with new features and improvements.
